During the New Year's Eve, between preparations of a beef Wellington and the dessert, I put 300g of sourdough to work and made a batch of dough for 4 loafs.

This is my third attempt and they got better volume each time. Ironically, I believe that while I streched out the butter pastry dough a bit too far (I should've rolled it out a bit more before I put the beef on it and not stretch it in order to cover the bottom), I might have been to careful with the sourdough during the bake off.
