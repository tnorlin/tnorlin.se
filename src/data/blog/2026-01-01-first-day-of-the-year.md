During the New Year's Eve, between preparations of a beef Wellington and the dessert, I put 300g of sourdough to work and made a batch of dough for 4 loafs.

This is my third attempt and they got better volume each time, but I believe that while I streched the butter dough for the butter pastry dough, I might have been to careful with the sourdough during the bake off.
