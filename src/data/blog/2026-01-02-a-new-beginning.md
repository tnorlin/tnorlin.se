As I'm starting over at tnorlin.se, I had a second look at the content collections in Astro and i found out that I misunderstood the concept while building kubernaut.eu. At least that is my current belief.

Anyway, I feel that this will be cleaner and when I registered the kubernaut.eu domain, there were no "kubestronaut" title (I do, however, think that kubernaut is a better title. But that's another story) and I think that the domain name sets an expectation of content to be published. I can't tell if I'll stick to this domain name forever, but hopefully this domain makes better sense when publishing about other stuff than Kubernetes. I intend to keep posting on both https://medium.com/@norlin.t and here (where there will be no sorts of paywalls) but I plan to migrate all the content on Medium to this site as well.
