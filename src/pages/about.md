tnorlin.se is a personal blog about the stuff that have captured the interest of its author, Tony Norlin, throughout the years. The authors interests spans across various technologies and hobbies, it can be anything from italian food culture such as pasta, pizza, gelato and coffee to computer homelab infrastructure and photography. Or anything from the day-to-day life, such as baking a classic sourdough (levain) bread - -  things that stimulate my mental state during spare time.

In this blog there will be a mix of English and Swedish posts.  The postings on this site are my own and do not necessarily represent the postings, strategies or opinions of my employer.

This blog will consist of content formerly posted on my technical blog [kubernaut.eu](https://kubernaut.eu/) as there will be less time spending to update the platforms..
